9.	Evaluate profit margin and discount per product

## Data Analysis
1. Top 20 selling product based on revenue
   ``` sql
   SELECT 
	      DISTINCT sod.ProductID, 
	      pp.Name,
        pp.ProductNumber,
	      pp.ProductLine,
	      sod.OrderQty,
	      sod.UnitPrice,
	      sod.UnitPrice * (1 - sod.UnitPriceDiscount) * sod.OrderQty  AS TotalRevenue
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS sod
   LEFT JOIN Production.Product AS pp ON sod.ProductID=pp.ProductID
   ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
   OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY;
   ```

Result:

   ``` sql
   WITH AllCustomers AS (
    SELECT 
        BusinessEntityID,
        CONCAT(FirstName, ' ',
               ISNULL(MiddleName, ''), ' ',
               LastName) AS CustomerName
    FROM Person.Person

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        BusinessEntityID,
        Name AS CustomerName
    FROM Sales.Store
   )
   SELECT
    soh.CustomerID,
	ac.CustomerName,
	COUNT(soh.SalesOrderID) AS TotalOrders,
    MAX(soh.OrderDate) AS FirstPurchase,
	MIN(soh.OrderDate) AS LastPurchase
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
   LEFT JOIN AllCustomers AS ac
    ON soh.CustomerID = ac.BusinessEntityID
   WHERE soh.OrderDate >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, 2014) AND ac.CustomerName IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY soh.customerID, ac.CustomerName
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT soh.SalesOrderID) > 1
   ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;

	SUM(sod.OrderQty) AS TotalOrder,
	SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS Revenue
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
    LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS sod 
	ON soh.SalesOrderID = sod.SalesOrderID

		ON pp.ProductSubcategoryID = ps.ProductSubcategoryID
			LEFT JOIN Production.ProductCategory AS pc
			ON ps.ProductCategoryID = pc.ProductCategoryID
   GROUP BY pc.Name, DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate), pp.Name, ps.Name
   ORDER BY category ASC, quarter ASC;
   ```


5. Does delay in shipping vary with month?
   ``` sql
   SELECT
	MONTH(soh.OrderDate) AS month,
	DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate) AS Qtr,
	AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, soh.OrderDate, soh.ShipDate)) AS avgshipdelay,
	AVG(soh.Freight) AS avgfrieghtcost
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
   GROUP BY MONTH(soh.OrderDate), DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate)
   ORDER BY Qtr, month;
   ```

6. Sales by Region and Channel
   ``` sql
   SELECT
	st.Name AS territory,
	st.[Group] AS territorygroup,
	DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate) AS Qtr,
	SUM(sod.OrderQty) AS unitsold,
	SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS revenue,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN soh.OnlineOrderFlag = 0 THEN 0 END) AS saleperson_channel,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN soh.OnlineOrderFlag = 1 THEN 1 END) AS online_order_channel
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS sod
   LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
	ON sod.SalesOrderID = soh.SalesOrderID
	LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory AS st
	ON soh.TerritoryID = st.TerritoryID
   GROUP BY st.Name, st.[Group], DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate)
   ORDER BY territory, Qtr, revenue;
   ```

7. Sales Performance amongst regions
   ``` sql
   SELECT
	st.Name AS Region,
	st.[Group] AS Regiongroup,
	DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate) AS Qtr,
	SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS revenue
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
	LEFT JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory AS st
	ON soh.TerritoryID = st.TerritoryID
   GROUP BY st.Name, st.[Group], DATENAME(QUARTER, soh.OrderDate)
